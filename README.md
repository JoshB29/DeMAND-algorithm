# DeMAND-algorithm
The Drug Mechanism of Action Algorithm Developed in the Califano Lab

## Introduction

The DeMAND algorithm was developed in the lab of Andrea Califano. The first authors are Jung Hoon Woo and Yishai Shimoni. The corresponding authors are Mukesh Bansal and Andrea Califano. For further information about the algorithm, please see the included guide

The original version of DeMAND was written by Jung Hoon Woo. A faster version (DeMANDfast) was written by Alexander Lachmann. In my benchmark analysis, DeMANDfast is about 3-10 times faster than DeMAND, and the results are nearly identical.
